Welcome to my academic website! My research focuses on developing and combining optical instrumentation, computational methods, and biophysical modeling to explore tissue physiology, with emphasis on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and related techniques. I am particularly interested in improving instrumentation for assessing neurophysiological parameters (such as cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption) and utilising these fNIRS-based techniques to better investigate brain function from an integrative perspective. 

Some key areas of expertise include clinical applications of fNIRS and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS), brain connectivity and its underlying complexity, and the biophysical modelling of neurovascular coupling. I am always open to collaboration and welcome inquiries from students, researchers, and colleagues interested in these topics. Please feel free to reach out to discuss research opportunities, potential collaborations, or any questions you may have.

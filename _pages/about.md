Welcome to my academic website! My research is focused on developing and combining optical instrumentation, computational methods, and biophysical modeling for functional neuroimaging, with emphasis on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and imaging techniques. I am particularly interested in developing better instrumentation for assessing neurophysiological quantities such as cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption, and  utilising these fNIRS-based techniques to better understand brain function from an integrative perspective. Some of the key areas I specialize in include: clinical applications of functional NIRS and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS); brain connectivity and its complexity; biophysical modelling of neurovascular coupling. 

I am open to collaboration and welcome inquiries from students and fellow researchers who want to pursue a deep understanding on these topics. Feel free to contact me to discuss research opportunities, collaborations, or any questions you may have.

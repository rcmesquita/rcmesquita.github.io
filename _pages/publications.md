Below you can find a list of selected peer-reviewed publications in reversed chronological order. All publications are tagged with their main field of research and color-coded according to my main research interests (advances in diffuse optics in purple, functional neuroimaging applications in blue, clinical applications in green, and reviews & special contributions in grey).

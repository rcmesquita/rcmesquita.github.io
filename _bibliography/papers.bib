Since its first description in 1993, fNIRS has undergone substantial developments in hardware, analysis techniques, and applications. Thirty years later, this technique is significantly enchancing our understanding in diverse areas of neuroscience research such as neurodevelopment, cognitive neuroscience, psychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative conditions, and brain injury management in intensive care settings. This special issue outlines the latest progress in instrumentation and analysis techniques and showcases some applications within the expanding field of fNIRS over the past decade.}},

Outcome measures were taken at 6 (PT = 26/FT = 21 infants) and 12 months (PT = 15/FT = 14 infants). At 6 months, poorer tactile reactivity was observed in PT, but not confirmed at 12 months. At 6 months, cortical response to tactile stimulus was found in the primary sensorimotor cortex and differences between groups did not reach significance. At 12 months, cortical response was found in the primary sensorimotor cortex and premotor area and in the somatosensory associative area, with significant less frequent response in premotor area in PT. The findings reinforce fNIRS as a tool to complement the knowledge of tactile adaptive behaviors in PT in early life.}},

abstract = {{**Significance**: The sensitivity to extracerebral tissues is a well-known confounder of diffuse optics. Two-layer (2L) head models can separate cerebral signals from extracerebral artifacts, but they also carry the risk of crosstalk between fitting parameters. 
Aim: We aim to implement a constrained 2L head model for hybrid diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and frequency-domain diffuse optical spectroscopy (FD-DOS) data and to characterize errors in cerebral blood flow and tissue absorption with the proposed model.

Approach: The algorithm uses the analytical solution of a 2L cylinder and an a priori extracerebral layer thickness to fit multidistance FD-DOS (0.8 to 4 cm) and DCS (0.8 and 2.5 cm) data, assuming homogeneous tissue reduced scattering. We characterized the algorithm’s accuracy for simulated data with noise generated using a 2L slab and realistic adult head geometries and for in vitro phantom data.

Results: Our algorithm recovered the cerebral flow index with 6.3 [2.8, 13.2]\% and 34 [30, 42]\% (median absolute percent error [interquartile range]) for slab and head geometries, respectively. Corresponding errors in the cerebral absorption coefficient were 5.0 [3.0, 7.9]\% and 4.6 [2.4, 7.2]\% for the slab and head geometries and 8 [5, 12]\% for our phantom experiment. Our results were minimally sensitive to second-layer scattering changes and were robust to cross-talk between fitting parameters.

Conclusions: In adults, the constrained 2L algorithm promises to improve FD-DOS/DCS accuracy compared with the conventional semi-infinite approach.}},

abstract = {{Brain fingerprinting refers to identifying participants based on their functional patterns. Despite its success with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain fingerprinting with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) still lacks adequate validation. We investigated how fNIRS-specific acquisition features (limited spatial information and nonneural contributions) influence resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) patterns at the intra-subject level and, therefore, brain fingerprinting. We performed multiple simultaneous fNIRS and fMRI measurements in 29 healthy participants at rest. Data were preprocessed following the best practices, including the removal of motion artifacts and global physiology. The rsFC maps were extracted with the Pearson correlation coefficient. Brain fingerprinting was tested with pairwise metrics and a simple linear classifier. Our results show that average classification accuracy with fNIRS ranges from 75\% to 98\%, depending on the number of runs and brain regions used for classification. Under the right conditions, brain fingerprinting with fNIRS is close to the 99.9\% accuracy found with fMRI. Overall, the classification accuracy is more impacted by the number of runs and the spatial coverage than the choice of the classification algorithm. This work provides evidence that brain fingerprinting with fNIRS is robust and reliable for extracting unique individual features at the intra-subject level once relevant spatiotemporal constraints are correctly employed.}},

abstract = {{Deeper insight into the molecular pathways that orchestrate skeletal myogenesis should enhance our understanding of, and ability to treat, human skeletal muscle disease. It is now widely appreciated that nutrients, such as molecular oxygen (O2), modulate skeletal muscle formation. During early stages of development and regeneration, skeletal muscle progenitors reside in low O2 environments before local blood vessels and differentiated muscle form. Moreover, low O2 availability (hypoxia) impedes progenitor-dependent myogenesis in vitro through multiple mechanisms, including activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). However, whether HIF1α regulates skeletal myogenesis in vivo is not known. Here, we explored the role of HIF1α during murine skeletal muscle development and regeneration. Our results demonstrate that HIF1α is dispensable during embryonic and fetal myogenesis. However, HIF1α negatively regulates adult muscle regeneration after ischemic injury, implying that it coordinates adult myogenesis with nutrient availability in vivo. Analyses of Hif1a mutant muscle and Hif1a-depleted muscle progenitors further suggest that HIF1α represses myogenesis through inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling. Our data provide the first evidence that HIF1α regulates skeletal myogenesis in vivo and establish a novel link between HIF and Wnt signaling in this context.}},

The scheme determines subject-specific contributions of extracerebral and cerebral tissues to the DCS signal by utilizing probe pressure modulation to induce variations in extracerebral blood flow. For analysis, the head is modeled as a two-layer medium and is probed with long and short source-detector separations. Then a combination of pressure modulation and a modified Beer-Lambert law for flow enables experimenters to linearly relate differential DCS signals to cerebral and extracerebral blood flow variation without a priori anatomical information. We demonstrate the algorithm's ability to isolate cerebral blood flow during a finger-tapping task and during graded scalp ischemia in healthy adults. Finally, we adapt the pressure modulation algorithm to ameliorate extracerebral contamination in monitoring of cerebral blood oxygenation and blood volume by near-infrared spectroscopy.}},

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:Alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygenation are implicated in altitude-associated diseases. We assessed the dynamic changes in CBF and peripheral and cerebral oxygenation engendered by ascent to altitude with partial acclimatization and hyperventilation using a combination of near-infrared spectroscopy, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and diffuse correlation spectroscopy. 
METHODS:Peripheral (Spo2) and cerebral (Scto2) oxygenation, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), and cerebral hemodynamics were studied in 12 subjects using transcranial Doppler and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) at 75 m and then 2 days and 7 days after ascending to 4559 m above sea level. After obtaining baseline measurements, subjects hyperventilated to reduce baseline ETCO2 by 50\%, and a further set of measurements were obtained.

RESULTS:Cerebral oxygenation and peripheral oxygenation showed a divergent response, with cerebral oxygenation decreasing at day 2 and decreasing further at day 7 at altitude, whereas peripheral oxygenation decreased on day 2 before partially rebounding on day 7. Cerebral oxygenation decreased after hyperventilation at sea level (Scto2 from 68.8\% to 63.5\%; P<.001), increased after hyperventilation after 2 days at altitude (Scto2 from 65.6\% to 69.9\%; P=.001), and did not change after hyperventilation after 7 days at altitude (Scto2 from 62.2\% to 63.3\%; P=.35).

CONCLUSIONS:An intensification of the normal cerebral hypocapnic vasoconstrictive response occurred after partial acclimatization in the setting of divergent peripheral and cerebral oxygenation. This may help explain why hyperventilation fails to improve cerebral oxygenation after partial acclimatization as it does after initial ascent. The use of DCS is feasible at altitude and provides a direct measure of CBF indices with high temporal resolution.}},

A cross-sectional study of 73 six-month-old infants was conducted (35 full-term and 38 preterm infants). Motor performance was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development third edition—Bayley-III. Brain hemodynamic activity during motor task was measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Motor performance was similar in full-term and preterm infants. However, differences in hemodynamic response were identified. Full terms showed a more homogeneous unilateral and contralateral activated area, whereas in preterm-born the activation response was predominantly bilateral. The full-term group also exhibited a shorter latency for the hemodynamic response than the preterm group. Hemodynamic activity in the left sensorimotor region was positively associated with motor performance measured by Bayley-III. The results highlight the adequacy of fNIRS to assess differences in task-induced activation in sensorimotor cortex between groups. The association between motor performance and the hemodynamic activity require further investigation and suggest that fNIRS can become a suitable auxiliary tool to investigate aspects of neural basis on early development of motor abilities.}},

abstract = {{Background Pleasure is a key factor for physical activity behavior in sedentary individuals. Inhibitory cognitive control may play an important role in pleasure perception while exercising, especially at high intensities. In addition, separate work suggests that autonomic regulation and cerebral hemodynamics influence the affective and cognitive responses during exercise. Purpose We investigated the effects of exercise intensity on affect, inhibitory control, cardiac autonomic function, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation. Methods Thirty-seven sedentary young adults performed two experimental conditions (exercise and control) in separate sessions in a repeated-measures design. In the exercise condition, participants performed a maximum graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer as we continuously measured oxygen consumption, heart rate variability (HRV), and PFC oxygenation. At each of 8 intensity levels we also measured inhibitory control (Stroop test), associative and dissociative thoughts (ADT), and affective/pleasure ratings. In the control condition, participants sat motionless on a cycle ergometer without active pedaling, and we collected the same measures at the same points in time as the exercise condition. We evaluated the main effects and interactions of exercise condition and intensity level for each measure using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between affect and inhibitory control, ADT, HRV, and PFC oxygenation using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Results For exercise intensities below and at the ventilatory threshold (VT), participants reported feeling neutral, with preservation of inhibitory control, while intensities above the VT were associated with displeasure (p<0.001), decreased inhibitory control and HRV (p<0.001), and increased PFC oxygenation (p<0.001). At the highest exercise intensity, pleasure was correlated with the low-frequency index of HRV (r = -0.34; p<0.05) and the low-frequency/high-frequency HRV ratio (r = -0.33; p<0.05). PFC deoxyhemoglobin was correlated with pleasure two stages above the VT (r = -0.37; p<0.05). Conclusion Our results support the notion that exercise at high intensities influences inhibitory control and one’s perception of pleasure, which are linked to changes in cardiac autonomic control and cerebral hemodynamics. These findings strengthen the existence of an integrated brain-heart-body system and highlight the importance of exercise intensity in exercise-related behavior in sedentary individuals.}},

Methods Fourteen individuals under SUD treatment performed a maximum graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer with continuous measurements of oxygen consumption, PFC oxygenation, and inhibitory control (Stroop test) every two minutes of exercise at different intensities. Fifteen non-SUD individuals performed the same protocol and were used as control group. Results Exercise increased oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and total hemoglobin (tHb) by 9\% and 7\%, respectively. However, when compared to a non-SUD group, this increase was lower at high intensities (p<0.001), and the inhibitory cognitive control was lower at rest and during exercise (p<0.007). In addition, PFC hemodynamics during exercise was inversely correlated with inhibitory cognitive performance (reaction time) (r = -0.62, p = 0.001), and a lower craving perception for the specific abused substance (p = 0.0189) was reported immediately after exercise.

Unfortunately, use of the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score (mTICI) to characterize recanalization of the cerebral vasculature does not address microvascular perfusion of the distal parenchyma, nor provide more than a vascular "snapshot." Thus, little is known about tissue-level hemodynamic consequences of LVO recanalization. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) are promising methods for continuous, noninvasive, contrast-free transcranial monitoring of cerebral microvasculature. 
METHODS:Here, we use a combined DCS/DOS system to monitor frontal lobe hemodynamic changes during endovascular treatment of 2 patients with ischemic stroke due to internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:The monitoring instrument identified a recanalization-induced increase in ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (CBF) with little or no concurrent change in contralateral CBF and extracerebral blood flow. The results suggest that diffuse optical monitoring is sensitive to intracerebral hemodynamics in patients with ICA occlusion and can measure microvascular responses to mechanical thrombectomy.}},

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Subjects with AIS in the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral artery territory were enrolled within 96 hours of symptom onset. DCS measured relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the bilateral frontal lobes for 15 minutes at rest (baseline), during a 30-minute infusion of 500 cc NS (bolus), and for 15 minutes after completion (post-bolus). Mean rCBF for each time period was calculated for individual subjects and median rCBF for the population was compared between time periods. Linear regression was used to evaluate for associations between rCBF and clinical features.

RESULTS:Among 57 subjects, median rCBF (IQR) increased relative to baseline in the ipsilesional hemisphere by 17\% (-2.0\%, 43.1\%), P< 0.001, and in the contralesional hemisphere by 13.3\% (-4.3\%, 36.0\%), P < .004. No significant associations were found between ipsilesional changes in rCBF and age, race, infarct size, infarct location, presence of large vessel stenosis, NIH stroke scale, or symptom duration.

CONCLUSION:A 500 cc bolus of .9\% NS produced a measurable increase in rCBF in both the affected and nonaffected hemispheres. Clinical features did not predict rCBF response.}},

Average age was 65 years, and 35\% were female. Frontal lobe tissue perfusion and middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) were continuously monitored with optical diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, respectively. High-level RI resulted in a 7\% increase in MCAv (p = 0.004). MCAv varied across all studied levels (baseline vs low-level vs high-level, p = 0.006), with a significant test of trend (p = 0.002). Changes were not seen in DCS measured tissue perfusion by nonparametric pairwise comparison. Mixed effects regression analysis identified a small increase in both MCAv (low-level RI: β 2.1, p < 0.001; high-level RI: β 5.0, p < 0.001) and tissue-level flow (low-level RI: β 5.4, p < 0.001; high-level RI: β 5.9, p < 0.001). There was a small increase in mean arterial pressure during low-level and high-level RI, 4\% (p = 0.013) and 4\% (p = 0.017), respectively. End-tidal CO2 remained stable throughout the protocol. RI was well tolerated. Manipulating intrathoracic pressure via noninvasive RI was safe and produced a small but measurable increase in cerebral perfusion in acute ischemic stroke patients. Future studies are warranted to assess whether RI is feasible and tolerable for prolonged use in hyperacute stroke management.}},

By performing test-retest protocols over different functional tasks, several studies agree that the fNIRS signal is reproducible over group analysis, but the inter-subject and within-subject reproducibility is poor. The high variability at the first statistical level is often attributed to global systemic physiology. In the present work, we revisited the reproducibility of the fNIRS signal during a finger-tapping task across multiple sessions on the same and different days. We expanded on previous studies by hypothesizing that the lack of spatial information of the optodes contributes to the low reproducibility in fNIRS, and we incorporated a real-time neuronavigation protocol to provide accurate cortical localization of the optodes. Our proposed approach was validated in 10 healthy volunteers, and our results suggest that the addition of neuronavigation can increase the within-subject reproducibility of the fNIRS data, particularly in the region of interest. Unlike traditional approaches to positioning the optodes, in which low intra-subject reproducibility has been found, we were able to obtain consistent and robust activation of the contralateral primary motor cortex at the intra-subject level using a neuronavigation protocol. Overall, our findings support the hypothesis that at least part of the variability in fNIRS cannot be only attributed to global systemic physiology. The use of neuronavigation to guide probe positioning, as proposed in this work, has impacts to longitudinal protocols performed with fNIRS.}},

abstract = {{<p>Monitoring speech tasks with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) enables investigation of speech production mechanisms and informs treatment strategies for speech-related disorders such as stuttering. Unfortunately, due to movement of the temporalis muscle, speech production can induce relative movement between probe optodes and skin. These movements generate motion artifacts during speech tasks. In practice, spurious hemodynamic responses in functional activation signals arise from lack of information about the consequences of speech-related motion artifacts, as well as from lack of standardized processing procedures for fNIRS signals during speech tasks. To this end, we characterize the effects of speech production on fNIRS signals, and we introduce a systematic analysis to ameliorate motion artifacts. The study measured 50 healthy subjects performing jaw movement (JM) tasks and found that JM produces two different patterns of motion artifacts in fNIRS. To remove these unwanted contributions, we validate a hybrid motion-correction algorithm based sequentially on spline interpolation and then wavelet filtering. We compared performance of the hybrid algorithm with standard algorithms based on spline interpolation only and wavelet decomposition only. The hybrid algorithm corrected 94\% of the artifacts produced by JM, and it did not lead to spurious responses in the data. We also validated the hybrid algorithm during a reading task performed under two different conditions: reading aloud and reading silently. For both conditions, we observed significant cortical activation in brain regions related to reading. Moreover, when comparing the two conditions, good agreement of spatial and temporal activation patterns was found only when data were analyzed using the hybrid approach. Overall, the study demonstrates a standardized processing scheme for fNIRS data during speech protocols. The scheme decreases spurious responses and intersubject variability due to motion artifacts.</p>}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has become an attractive choice to neuroscience because of its high temporal resolution, ease of use, non-invasiveness, and affordability. With the advent of wearable fNIRS technology, on-the-spot studies of brain function have become viable. However, the lack of within-subject reproducibility is one of the barriers to the full acceptability of fNIRS. To support the validation of the claim that within-subject reproducibility of fNIRS could benefit from accurate anatomical information, we present in this paper a method to develop an image-based system that improves the placement of the sensors on the scalp at interactive rates. 
METHODS:The proposed solution consists of an electromagnetic digitizer and an interactive visualization system that allows monitoring the movements of the digitizer on a real head with respect to the underlying cerebral cortical structures. GPU-based volume raycasting rendering is applied to unveil these structures from the corresponding magnetic resonance imaging volume. Scalp and cortical surface are estimated from the scanned volume to improve depth perception. An alignment algorithm between the real and scanned heads is devised to visually feedback the position of the stylus of the digitizer. Off-screen rendering of the depthmaps of the visible surfaces makes spatial positioning of a 2D interaction pointer possible.

RESULTS:We evaluated the alignment accuracy using four to eight anatomical landmarks and found seven to be a good compromise between precision and efficiency. Next, we evaluated reproducibility in positioning five arbitrarily chosen points on three volunteers by four operators over five sessions. In every session, seven anatomical landmarks were applied in the alignment of the real and the scanned head. For the same volunteer, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant differences within the five points digitized by the same operator over five sessions (α = 0.05). In addition, preliminary study of motor cortex activation by right-hand finger tapping showed the potential of our approach to increase functional fNIRS reproducibility.

CONCLUSIONS:Results of experiments suggest that the enhancement of the visualization of the location of the probes on the scalp, relative to the underlying cortical structures, improves reproducibility of fNIRS measurements. As further work, we plan to study the fNIRS reproducibility in other cortical regions and in clinical settings using the proposed system.}},

abstract = {{The cortical microvascular cerebral blood flow response (CBF) to different changes in head-of-bed (HOB) position has been shown to be altered in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) by diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) technique. However, the relationship between these relative ΔCBF changes and associated systemic blood pressure changes has not been studied, even though blood pressure is a major driver of cerebral blood flow. Transcranial DCS data from four studies measuring bilateral frontal microvascular cerebral blood flow in healthy controls (n = 15), patients with asymptomatic severe internal carotid artery stenosis (ICA, n = 27), and patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS, n = 72) were aggregated. DCS-measured CBF was measured in response to a short head-of-bed (HOB) position manipulation protocol (supine/elevated/supine, 5 min at each position). In a sub-group (AIS, n = 26; ICA, n = 14; control, n = 15), mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured dynamically during the protocol. After elevated positioning, DCS CBF returned to baseline supine values in controls (p = 0.890) but not in patients with AIS (9.6\% [6.0,13.3], mean 95\% CI, p < 0.001) or ICA stenosis (8.6\% [3.1,14.0], p = 0.003)). MAP in AIS patients did not return to baseline values (2.6 mmHg [0.5, 4.7], p = 0.018), but in ICA stenosis patients and controls did. Instead ipsilesional but not contralesional CBF was correlated with MAP (AIS 6.0\%/mmHg [− 2.4,14.3], p = 0.038; ICA stenosis 11.0\%/mmHg [2.4,19.5], p < 0.001). The observed associations between ipsilateral CBF and MAP suggest that short HOB position changes may elicit deficits in cerebral autoregulation in cerebrovascular disorders. Additional research is required to further characterize this phenomenon.}},

abstract = {{Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is a common vascular disease with long-term consequences for the brain. Although CAS is strongly associated with impaired cerebral hemodynamics and neurodegeneration, the mechanisms underlying hemodynamic impairment in the microvasculature remain unknown. In this work, we employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to introduce a methodological approach for quantifying the temporal delay of the evoked hemodynamic response. The method was validated during a vasodilatory task (breath-holding) in 50 CAS patients and 20 controls. Our results suggest that the hemodynamic response to breath-holding can be delayed by up to 6 s in the most severe patients, a significant increase from the median 4 s measured for the control group (p = 0.01). In addition, the fraction of brain regions that responded to the task decreased as the CAS severity increased, from a median of 90\% in controls to 73\% in the most severe CAS group (p = 0.04). The presence of collateral circulation increases the response to breath-holding and decreases the average time delays across the brain, although the number of communicating arteries alone cannot predict these fNIRS-based hemodynamic variables (p > 0.09). Overall, this work proposes a method to quantitatively assess impaired cerebral hemodynamics in CAS patients.}},

abstract = {{The study of functional reorganization following stroke has been steadily growing supported by advances in neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Concomitantly, graph theory has been increasingly employed in neuroscience to model the brain's functional connectivity (FC) and to investigate it in a variety of contexts. The aims of this study were: 1) to investigate the reorganization of network topology in the ipsilesional (IL) and contralesional (CL) hemispheres of stroke patients with (motor stroke group) and without (control stroke group) motor impairment, and 2) to predict motor recovery through the relationship between local topological variations of the functional network and increased motor function. We modeled the brain's FC as a graph using fMRI data, and we characterized its interactions with the following graph metrics: degree, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and betweenness centrality (BC). For both patient groups, BC yielded the largest variations between the two analyzed time points, especially in the motor stroke group. This group presented significant correlations (P<0.05) between average BC changes and the improvements in upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer (UE-FM) scores at the primary sensorimotor cortex and the supplementary motor area for the CL hemisphere. These regions participate in processes related to the selection, planning, and execution of movement. Generally, higher increases in average BC over these areas were related to larger improvements in UE-FM assessment. Although the sample was small, these results suggest the possibility of using BC as an indication of brain plasticity mechanisms following stroke.}},

It is demonstrated in the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging literature that frontoparietal networks are involved with attentive performance while default mode networks are involved with inattentive performance. Yet, it is still not clear whether similar results would be found with functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy. The goal of our study was to investigate differences in hemodynamic activity measured by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy between fast and slow responses on a simple sustained attention task both before and after stimulus onset. Thirty healthy adults took part in the study. Our results have shown differences between fast and slow responses only on channels over medial frontal cortex and inferior parietal cortex (p < 0,05). These differences were observed both before and after stimulus presentation. It is discussed that functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy is a good tool to investigate the frontoparietal network and its relationship with performance in attention tasks; it could be used to further investigate other approaches on attention, such as the dual network model of cognitive control and brain states views based on complex systems analysis; and finally, it could be used to investigate attention in naturalistic settings.}},

abstract = {{Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) has gained popularity mainly due to its simplicity and potential for providing insights into various brain disorders. In this vein, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an attractive choice due to its portability, flexibility, and low cost, allowing for bedside imaging of brain function. While promising, fNIRS suffers from non-neural signal contaminations (i.e., systemic physiological noise), which can increase correlation across fNIRS channels, leading to spurious rsFC networks. In the present work, we hypothesized that additional measurements with short channels, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and end-tidal CO2 could provide a better understanding of the effects of systemic physiology on fNIRS-based resting-state networks. To test our hypothesis, we acquired 12 min of resting-state data from 10 healthy participants. Unlike previous studies, we investigated the efficacy of different pre-processing approaches in extracting resting-state networks. Our results are in agreement with previous studies and reinforce the fact that systemic physiology can overestimate rsFC. We expanded on previous work by showing that removal of systemic physiology decreases intra- and inter-subject variability, increasing the ability to detect neural changes in rsFC across groups and over longitudinal studies. Our results show that by removing systemic physiology, fNIRS can reproduce resting-state networks often reported with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Finally, the present work details the effects of systemic physiology and outlines how to remove (or at least ameliorate) their contributions to fNIRS signals acquired at rest.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:A primary goal of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) management is to maximize perfusion in the affected region and surrounding ischemic penumbra. However, interventions to maximize perfusion, such as flat head-of-bed (HOB) positioning, are currently prescribed empirically. Bedside monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) allows the effects of interventions such as flat HOB to be monitored and may ultimately be used to guide clinical management. 
METHODS:Cerebral perfusion was measured during HOB manipulations in 17 patients with unilateral AIS affecting large cortical territories in the anterior circulation. Simultaneous measurements of frontal CBF and arterial flow velocity were performed with diffuse correlation spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, respectively. Results were analyzed in the context of available clinical data and a previous study.

RESULTS:Frontal CBF, averaged over the patient cohort, decreased by 17\% (P=0.034) and 15\% (P=0.011) in the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres, respectively, when HOB was changed from flat to 30°. Significant (cohort-averaged) changes in blood velocity were not observed. Individually, varying responses to HOB manipulation were observed, including paradoxical increases in CBF with increasing HOB angle. Clinical features, stroke volume, and distance to the optical probe could not explain this paradoxical response.

CONCLUSIONS:A lower HOB angle results in an increase in cortical CBF without a significant change in arterial flow velocity in AIS, but there is variability across patients in this response. Bedside CBF monitoring with diffuse correlation spectroscopy provides a potential means to individualize interventions designed to optimize CBF in AIS.}},

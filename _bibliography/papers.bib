  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

Here, we use direct electrophysiological recordings to predict blood flow and oxygenation changes measured with optical methods during parametric stimulation applied to the somatosensory cortex in rat brain. Using a multimodal model of the cerebral functional unit, we estimate a neuro-vascular and a neuro-metabolic transfer function relating the experimentally measured neural responses with the inputs to a vascular model predicting hemodynamic and blood oxygenation changes. We show that our model can accurately predict experimentally measured parametric hemodynamic evoked responses by using a single linear transfer function relationship with a reduced number of state parameters to relate the level of neural activity to evoked cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism changes. At the same time, we characterize the metabolic and vascular neural response functions and interpret their physiological significance.}},

By choosing a source-detector pair as a seed, we calculated the correlation value between its time course and the time course of all other source-detector combinations, and projected them onto a topographic map. In all subjects, we found robust spatial interactions in agreement with previous fMRI and NIRS findings. Strong correlations between the two opposite hemispheres were seen for both sensorimotor and visual cortices. Correlations in the prefrontal cortex were more heterogeneous and dependent on the hemodynamic contrast. HbT provided robust, well defined maps, suggesting that this contrast may be used to better localize functional connectivity. The effects of global systemic physiology were also investigated, particularly low frequency blood pressure oscillations which give rise to broad regions of high correlation and mislead interpretation of the results. These results confirm the feasibility of using functional connectivity with optical methods during the resting state, and validate its use to investigate cortical interactions across the whole head.}},

abstract = {{Murine hindlimb ischemia is a useful model for investigation of the mechanisms of peripheral arterial disease and for understanding the role of endothelial cells and generic factors affecting vascular regeneration or angiogenesis. To date, important research with these models has explored tissue reperfusion following ischemia with Laser Doppler methods, methods which provide information about superficial (\textbackslashtextasciitildemm) vascular regeneration. In this work, we employ diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) in mice after hindlimb ischemia. We hypothesize that vascular re-growth is not uniform in tissue, and therefore, since diffuse optical methods are capable of probing deep tissues, that the diffuse optics approach will provide a more complete picture of the angiogenesis process throughout the whole depth profile of the limb. Besides increased depth penetration, the combined measurements of DCS and DOS enable all-optical, noninvasive, longitudinal monitoring of tissue perfusion and oxygenation that reveals the interplay between these hemodynamic parameters during angiogenesis. Control mice were found to reestablish 90\% of perfusion and oxygen consumption during this period, but oxygen saturation in the limb only partially recovered to about 30\% of its initial value. The vascular recovery of mice with endothelial cell-specific deletion of HIF-2α was found to be significantly impaired relative to control mice, indicating that HIF-2α is important for endothelial cell functions in angiogenesis. Comparison of DOS/DCS measurements to parallel measurements in the murine models using Laser Doppler Flowmetry reveal differences in the reperfusion achieved by superficial versus deep tissue during neoangiogenesis; findings from histological analysis of blood vessel development were further correlated with these differences. In general, the combination of DCS and DOS enables experimenters to obtain useful information about oxygenation, metabolism, and perfusion throughout the limb. The results establish diffuse optics as a practical noninvasive method to evaluate the role of transcription factors, such as the endothelial cell-specific HIF-2α, in genetic ally modified mice.}},

In this paper, we focus on the flow monitoring technique: diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS). Representative clinical and pre-clinical studies from our laboratory illustrate the potential of DCS. Validation of DCS blood flow indices in human brain and muscle is presented. Comparison of DCS with arterial spin-labelled MRI, xenon-CT and Doppler ultrasound shows good agreement (0.50<r<0.95) over a wide range of tissue types and source detector distances, corroborating the potential of the method to measure perfusion non-invasively and in vivo at the microvasculature level. All-optical measurements of cerebral oxygen metabolism in both rat brain, following middle cerebral artery occlusion, and human brain, during functional activation, are also described. In both situations, the use of combined DCS and diffuse optical spectroscopy/near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor changes in oxygen consumption by the tissue is demonstrated. Finally, recent results spanning from gene expression-induced angiogenic response to stroke care and cancer treatment monitoring are discussed. Collectively, the research illustrates the capability of DCS to quantitatively monitor perfusion from bench to bedside, providing results that match up both with literature findings and with similar experiments performed with other techniques.}},

The oxygen-responsive transcriptional regulator hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) is highly expressed in vascular ECs and, along with HIF-1α, activates expression of target genes whose products modulate vascular functions and angiogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which HIF-2α regulates EC function and tissue perfusion under physiological and pathological conditions are poorly understood. Using mice in which Hif2a was specifically deleted in ECs, we demonstrate here that HIF-2α expression is required for angiogenic responses during hindlimb ischemia and for the growth of autochthonous skin tumors. EC-specific Hif2a deletion resulted in increased vessel formation in both models; however, these vessels failed to undergo proper arteriogenesis, resulting in poor perfusion. Analysis of cultured HIF-2α-deficient ECs revealed cell-autonomous increases in migration, invasion, and morphogenetic activity, which correlated with HIF-2α-dependent expression of specific angiogenic factors, including delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), a Notch ligand, and angiopoietin 2. By stimulating Dll4 signaling in cultured ECs or restoring Dll4 expression in ischemic muscle tissue, we rescued most of the HIF-2α-dependent EC phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, emphasizing the critical role of Dll4/Notch signaling as a downstream target of HIF-2α in ECs. These results indicate that HIF-1α and HIF-2α fulfill complementary, but largely nonoverlapping, essential functions in pathophysiological angiogenesis.}},

Delineating the factors regulating these precursors will facilitate their reliable application in human muscle repair. During embryonic development and adult regeneration, skeletal muscle progenitors reside in low-O(2) environments before local blood vessels and differentiated muscle form. Prior studies established that low O(2) levels (hypoxia) maintained muscle progenitors in an undifferentiated state in vitro, although it remained unclear if progenitor differentiation was coordinated with O(2) availability in vivo. In addition, the molecular signals linking O(2) to progenitor differentiation are incompletely understood. Here we show that the muscle differentiation program is repressed by hypoxia in vitro and ischemia in vivo. Surprisingly, hypoxia can significantly impair differentiation in the absence of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), the primary developmental effectors of O(2). In order to maintain the undifferentiated state, low O(2) levels block the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway in a predominantly HIF1α-independent fashion. O(2) deprivation affects AKT activity by reducing insulin-like growth factor I receptor sensitivity to growth factors. We conclude that AKT represents a key molecular link between O(2) and skeletal muscle differentiation.}},

In the present report, baseline and stress-altered tumor hemodynamics as a function of murine strain were studied using radiation-induced fibrosacomas (RIF) grown in C3H or nude mice. Fluctuations in tumor blood flow during one hour of baseline monitoring or during vascular stress induced by photodynamic therapy (PDT) were measured by diffuse correlation spectroscopy. Baseline monitoring revealed fluctuating tumor blood flow highly correlated with heart rate and with similar median periods (i.e., ∼9 and 14 min in C3H and nudes, respectively). However, tumor blood flow in C3H animals was more sensitive to physiologic or stress-induced perturbations. Specifically, PDT-induced vascular insults produced greater decreases in blood flow in the tumors of C3H versus nude mice; similarly, during baseline monitoring, fluctuations in blood flow were more regular and more prevalent within the tumors of C3H mice versus nude mice; finally, the vasoconstrictor L-NNA reduced tumor blood flow in C3H mice but did not affect tumor blood flow in nudes. Underlying differences in vascular structure, such as smaller tumor blood vessels in C3H versus nude animals, may contribute to strain-dependent variation in vascular function. These data thus identify clear effects of mouse strain on tumor hemodynamics with consequences to PDT and potentially other vascular-mediated therapies.}},

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Head-of-bed manipulation is commonly performed in the neurocritical care unit to optimize cerebral blood flow (CBF), but its effects on CBF are rarely measured. This pilot study employs a novel, non-invasive instrument combining two techniques, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) for measurement of CBF and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for measurement of cerebral oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations, to monitor patients during head-of-bed lowering. METHODS: Ten brain-injured patients and ten control subjects were monitored continuously with DCS and NIRS while the head-of-bed was positioned first at 30° and then at 0°. Relative CBF (rCBF) and concurrent changes in oxy- (ΔHbO2), deoxy- (ΔHb), and total-hemoglobin concentrations (ΔTHC) from left/right frontal cortices were monitored for 5 min at each position. Patient and control response differences were assessed. RESULTS: rCBF, ΔHbO2, and ΔTHC responses to head lowering differed significantly between brain-injured patients and healthy controls (P < 0.02). For patients, rCBF changes were heterogeneous, with no net change observed in the group average (0.3 ± 28.2 \%, P = 0.938). rCBF increased in controls (18.6 ± 9.4 \%, P < 0.001). ΔHbO2, ΔHb, and ΔTHC increased with head lowering in both groups, but to a larger degree in brain-injured patients. rCBF correlated moderately with changes in cerebral perfusion pressure (R = 0.40, P < 0.001), but not intracranial pressure. CONCLUSION: DCS/NIRS detected differences in CBF and oxygenation responses of brain-injured patients versus controls during head-of-bed manipulation. This pilot study supports the feasibility of continuous bedside measurement of cerebrovascular hemodynamics with DCS/NIRS and provides the rationale for further investigation in larger cohorts.}},

While measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (S(t)O(2)) has been demonstrated, this is the first study to assess both S(t)O(2) and relative blood flow (rBF) in the extremities of PAD patients. Diffuse optics is employed to measure hemodynamic response to treadmill and pedal exercises in 31 healthy controls and 26 patients. For S(t)O(2), mild and moderate/severe PAD groups show pronounced differences compared with controls. Pre-exercise mean S(t)O(2) is lower in PAD groups by 9.3\% to 10.6\% compared with means of 63.5\% to 66.2\% in controls. For pedal, relative rate of return of S(t)O(2) to baseline is more rapid in controls (p < 0.05). Patterns of rBF also differ among groups. After both exercises, rBF tend to occur at depressed levels among severe PAD patients compared with healthy (p < 0.05); post-treadmill, rBF tend to occur at elevated levels among healthy compared with severe PAD patients (p < 0.05). Additionally, relative rate of return to baseline S(t)O(2) is more rapid among subjects with reduced levels of depression in rBF (p = 0.041), even after adjustment for ankle brachial index. This suggests a physiologic connection between rBF and oxygenation that can be measured using diffuse optics, and potentially employed as an evaluative tool in further studies.}},

This technical advance in neurological monitoring promises a new standard of care for detection of spinal cord ischemia and the opportunity for early intervention.

The induced variations were rapidly and reproducibly detected, demonstrating direct measurement of spinal cord ischemia in real-time.

Noninvasive optical methods are employed: diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) for blood flow and diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) for hemoglobin concentrations. A significant increase in median CBF (33\%) on the side ipsilateral to stimulation was observed during rTMS and persisted after discontinuation. The measured hemodynamic parameter variations enabled computation of relative changes in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption during rTMS, which increased significantly (28\%) in the stimulated hemisphere. By contrast, hemodynamic changes from baseline were not observed contralateral to rTMS administration (all parameters, p>0.29).

abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:A primary goal of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) management is to maximize perfusion in the affected region and surrounding ischemic penumbra. However, interventions to maximize perfusion, such as flat head-of-bed (HOB) positioning, are currently prescribed empirically. Bedside monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) allows the effects of interventions such as flat HOB to be monitored and may ultimately be used to guide clinical management. 
METHODS:Cerebral perfusion was measured during HOB manipulations in 17 patients with unilateral AIS affecting large cortical territories in the anterior circulation. Simultaneous measurements of frontal CBF and arterial flow velocity were performed with diffuse correlation spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, respectively. Results were analyzed in the context of available clinical data and a previous study.

RESULTS:Frontal CBF, averaged over the patient cohort, decreased by 17\% (P=0.034) and 15\% (P=0.011) in the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres, respectively, when HOB was changed from flat to 30°. Significant (cohort-averaged) changes in blood velocity were not observed. Individually, varying responses to HOB manipulation were observed, including paradoxical increases in CBF with increasing HOB angle. Clinical features, stroke volume, and distance to the optical probe could not explain this paradoxical response.

CONCLUSIONS:A lower HOB angle results in an increase in cortical CBF without a significant change in arterial flow velocity in AIS, but there is variability across patients in this response. Bedside CBF monitoring with diffuse correlation spectroscopy provides a potential means to individualize interventions designed to optimize CBF in AIS.}},

It is now widely appreciated that nutrients, such as molecular oxygen (O2), modulate skeletal muscle formation. During early stages of development and regeneration, skeletal muscle progenitors reside in low O2 environments before local blood vessels and differentiated muscle form. Moreover, low O2 availability (hypoxia) impedes progenitor-dependent myogenesis in vitro through multiple mechanisms, including activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). However, whether HIF1α regulates skeletal myogenesis in vivo is not known. Here, we explored the role of HIF1α during murine skeletal muscle development and regeneration. Our results demonstrate that HIF1α is dispensable during embryonic and fetal myogenesis. However, HIF1α negatively regulates adult muscle regeneration after ischemic injury, implying that it coordinates adult myogenesis with nutrient availability in vivo. Analyses of Hif1a mutant muscle and Hif1a-depleted muscle progenitors further suggest that HIF1α represses myogenesis through inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling. Our data provide the first evidence that HIF1α regulates skeletal myogenesis in vivo and establish a novel link between HIF and Wnt signaling in this context.}},

We assessed the dynamic changes in CBF and peripheral and cerebral oxygenation engendered by ascent to altitude with partial acclimatization and hyperventilation using a combination of near-infrared spectroscopy, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and diffuse correlation spectroscopy. 
METHODS:Peripheral (Spo2) and cerebral (Scto2) oxygenation, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), and cerebral hemodynamics were studied in 12 subjects using transcranial Doppler and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) at 75 m and then 2 days and 7 days after ascending to 4559 m above sea level. After obtaining baseline measurements, subjects hyperventilated to reduce baseline ETCO2 by 50\%, and a further set of measurements were obtained.

RESULTS:Cerebral oxygenation and peripheral oxygenation showed a divergent response, with cerebral oxygenation decreasing at day 2 and decreasing further at day 7 at altitude, whereas peripheral oxygenation decreased on day 2 before partially rebounding on day 7. Cerebral oxygenation decreased after hyperventilation at sea level (Scto2 from 68.8\% to 63.5\%; P<.001), increased after hyperventilation after 2 days at altitude (Scto2 from 65.6\% to 69.9\%; P=.001), and did not change after hyperventilation after 7 days at altitude (Scto2 from 62.2\% to 63.3\%; P=.35).

CONCLUSIONS:An intensification of the normal cerebral hypocapnic vasoconstrictive response occurred after partial acclimatization in the setting of divergent peripheral and cerebral oxygenation. This may help explain why hyperventilation fails to improve cerebral oxygenation after partial acclimatization as it does after initial ascent. The use of DCS is feasible at altitude and provides a direct measure of CBF indices with high temporal resolution.}},

Motor performance was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development third edition—Bayley-III. Brain hemodynamic activity during motor task was measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Motor performance was similar in full-term and preterm infants. However, differences in hemodynamic response were identified. Full terms showed a more homogeneous unilateral and contralateral activated area, whereas in preterm-born the activation response was predominantly bilateral. The full-term group also exhibited a shorter latency for the hemodynamic response than the preterm group. Hemodynamic activity in the left sensorimotor region was positively associated with motor performance measured by Bayley-III. The results highlight the adequacy of fNIRS to assess differences in task-induced activation in sensorimotor cortex between groups.

abstract = {{Background Pleasure is a key factor for physical activity behavior in sedentary individuals. Inhibitory cognitive control may play an important role in pleasure perception while exercising, especially at high intensities. In addition, separate work suggests that autonomic regulation and cerebral hemodynamics influence the affective and cognitive responses during exercise. Purpose We investigated the effects of exercise intensity on affect, inhibitory control, cardiac autonomic function, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation. Methods Thirty-seven sedentary young adults performed two experimental conditions (exercise and control) in separate sessions in a repeated-measures design. In the exercise condition, participants performed a maximum graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer as we continuously measured oxygen consumption, heart rate variability (HRV), and PFC oxygenation. At each of 8 intensity levels we also measured inhibitory control (Stroop test), associative and dissociative thoughts (ADT), and affective/pleasure ratings. In the control condition, participants sat motionless on a cycle ergometer without active pedaling, and we collected the same measures at the same points in time as the exercise condition. We evaluated the main effects and interactions of exercise condition and intensity level for each measure using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between affect and inhibitory control, ADT, HRV, and PFC oxygenation using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Results For exercise intensities below and at the ventilatory threshold (VT), participants reported feeling neutral, with preservation of inhibitory control, while intensities above the VT were associated with displeasure (p<0.001), decreased inhibitory control and HRV (p<0.001), and increased PFC oxygenation (p<0.001). At the highest exercise intensity, pleasure was correlated with the low-frequency index of HRV (r = -0.34; p<0.05) and the low-frequency/high-frequency HRV ratio (r = -0.33; p<0.05). PFC deoxyhemoglobin was correlated with pleasure two stages above the VT (r = -0.37; p<0.05). Conclusion Our results support the notion that exercise at high intensities influences inhibitory control and one’s perception of pleasure, which are linked to changes in cardiac autonomic control and cerebral hemodynamics. These findings strengthen the existence of an integrated brain-heart-body system and highlight the importance of exercise intensity in exercise-related behavior in sedentary individuals.}},

abstract = {{Background Individuals with Substance Use Disorder (SUD) have lower baseline metabolic activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) associated with impairment of cognitive functions in decision-making and inhibitory control. Aerobic exercise has shown to improve PFC function and cognitive performance, however, its effects on SUD individuals remain unclear. Purpose To verify the cognitive performance and oxygenation of the PFC during an incremental exercise in SUD individuals. Methods Fourteen individuals under SUD treatment performed a maximum graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer with continuous measurements of oxygen consumption, PFC oxygenation, and inhibitory control (Stroop test) every two minutes of exercise at different intensities. Fifteen non-SUD individuals performed the same protocol and were used as control group. Results Exercise increased oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and total hemoglobin (tHb) by 9\% and 7\%, respectively. However, when compared to a non-SUD group, this increase was lower at high intensities (p<0.001), and the inhibitory cognitive control was lower at rest and during exercise (p<0.007). In addition, PFC hemodynamics during exercise was inversely correlated with inhibitory cognitive performance (reaction time) (r = -0.62, p = 0.001), and a lower craving perception for the specific abused substance (p = 0.0189) was reported immediately after exercise. Conclusion Despite SUD individuals having their PFC cerebral oxygenation increased during exercise, they presented lower cognition and oxygenation when compared to controls, especially at elevated intensities. These results may reinforce the role of exercise as an adjuvant treatment to improve PFC function and cognitive control in individuals with SUD.}},

Unfortunately, use of the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score (mTICI) to characterize recanalization of the cerebral vasculature does not address microvascular perfusion of the distal parenchyma, nor provide more than a vascular "snapshot." Thus, little is known about tissue-level hemodynamic consequences of LVO recanalization. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) are promising methods for continuous, noninvasive, contrast-free transcranial monitoring of cerebral microvasculature. 
METHODS:Here, we use a combined DCS/DOS system to monitor frontal lobe hemodynamic changes during endovascular treatment of 2 patients with ischemic stroke due to internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:The monitoring instrument identified a recanalization-induced increase in ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (CBF) with little or no concurrent change in contralateral CBF and extracerebral blood flow. The results suggest that diffuse optical monitoring is sensitive to intracerebral hemodynamics in patients with ICA occlusion and can measure microvascular responses to mechanical thrombectomy.}},

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Subjects with AIS in the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral artery territory were enrolled within 96 hours of symptom onset. DCS measured relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the bilateral frontal lobes for 15 minutes at rest (baseline), during a 30-minute infusion of 500 cc NS (bolus), and for 15 minutes after completion (post-bolus). Mean rCBF for each time period was calculated for individual subjects and median rCBF for the population was compared between time periods. Linear regression was used to evaluate for associations between rCBF and clinical features.

RESULTS:Among 57 subjects, median rCBF (IQR) increased relative to baseline in the ipsilesional hemisphere by 17\% (-2.0\%, 43.1\%), P< 0.001, and in the contralesional hemisphere by 13.3\% (-4.3\%, 36.0\%), P < .004. No significant associations were found between ipsilesional changes in rCBF and age, race, infarct size, infarct location, presence of large vessel stenosis, NIH stroke scale, or symptom duration.

CONCLUSION:A 500 cc bolus of .9\% NS produced a measurable increase in rCBF in both the affected and nonaffected hemispheres. Clinical features did not predict rCBF response.}},

We assessed low-level (6 cm H2O) and high-level (12 cm H2O) RI in 17 spontaneously breathing patients within 72 h of anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke. Average age was 65 years, and 35\% were female. Frontal lobe tissue perfusion and middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) were continuously monitored with optical diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, respectively. High-level RI resulted in a 7\% increase in MCAv (p = 0.004). MCAv varied across all studied levels (baseline vs low-level vs high-level, p = 0.006), with a significant test of trend (p = 0.002). Changes were not seen in DCS measured tissue perfusion by nonparametric pairwise comparison. Mixed effects regression analysis identified a small increase in both MCAv (low-level RI: β 2.1, p < 0.001; high-level RI: β 5.0, p < 0.001) and tissue-level flow (low-level RI: β 5.4, p < 0.001; high-level RI: β 5.9, p < 0.001). There was a small increase in mean arterial pressure during low-level and high-level RI, 4\% (p = 0.013) and 4\% (p = 0.017), respectively. End-tidal CO2 remained stable throughout the protocol. RI was well tolerated. Manipulating intrathoracic pressure via noninvasive RI was safe and produced a small but measurable increase in cerebral perfusion in acute ischemic stroke patients. Future studies are warranted to assess whether RI is feasible and tolerable for prolonged use in hyperacute stroke management.}},

By performing test-retest protocols over different functional tasks, several studies agree that the fNIRS signal is reproducible over group analysis, but the inter-subject and within-subject reproducibility is poor. The high variability at the first statistical level is often attributed to global systemic physiology. In the present work, we revisited the reproducibility of the fNIRS signal during a finger-tapping task across multiple sessions on the same and different days. We expanded on previous studies by hypothesizing that the lack of spatial information of the optodes contributes to the low reproducibility in fNIRS, and we incorporated a real-time neuronavigation protocol to provide accurate cortical localization of the optodes. Our proposed approach was validated in 10 healthy volunteers, and our results suggest that the addition of neuronavigation can increase the within-subject reproducibility of the fNIRS data, particularly in the region of interest. Unlike traditional approaches to positioning the optodes, in which low intra-subject reproducibility has been found, we were able to obtain consistent and robust activation of the contralateral primary motor cortex at the intra-subject level using a neuronavigation protocol. Overall, our findings support the hypothesis that at least part of the variability in fNIRS cannot be only attributed to global systemic physiology. The use of neuronavigation to guide probe positioning, as proposed in this work, has impacts to longitudinal protocols performed with fNIRS.}},

abstract = {{<p>Monitoring speech tasks with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) enables investigation of speech production mechanisms and informs treatment strategies for speech-related disorders such as stuttering. Unfortunately, due to movement of the temporalis muscle, speech production can induce relative movement between probe optodes and skin. These movements generate motion artifacts during speech tasks. In practice, spurious hemodynamic responses in functional activation signals arise from lack of information about the consequences of speech-related motion artifacts, as well as from lack of standardized processing procedures for fNIRS signals during speech tasks. To this end, we characterize the effects of speech production on fNIRS signals, and we introduce a systematic analysis to ameliorate motion artifacts. The study measured 50 healthy subjects performing jaw movement (JM) tasks and found that JM produces two different patterns of motion artifacts in fNIRS. To remove these unwanted contributions, we validate a hybrid motion-correction algorithm based sequentially on spline interpolation and then wavelet filtering. We compared performance of the hybrid algorithm with standard algorithms based on spline interpolation only and wavelet decomposition only. The hybrid algorithm corrected 94\% of the artifacts produced by JM, and it did not lead to spurious responses in the data. We also validated the hybrid algorithm during a reading task performed under two different conditions: reading aloud and reading silently. For both conditions, we observed significant cortical activation in brain regions related to reading. Moreover, when comparing the two conditions, good agreement of spatial and temporal activation patterns was found only when data were analyzed using the hybrid approach. Overall, the study demonstrates a standardized processing scheme for fNIRS data during speech protocols. The scheme decreases spurious responses and intersubject variability due to motion artifacts.</p>}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has become an attractive choice to neuroscience because of its high temporal resolution, ease of use, non-invasiveness, and affordability. With the advent of wearable fNIRS technology, on-the-spot studies of brain function have become viable. However, the lack of within-subject reproducibility is one of the barriers to the full acceptability of fNIRS. To support the validation of the claim that within-subject reproducibility of fNIRS could benefit from accurate anatomical information, we present in this paper a method to develop an image-based system that improves the placement of the sensors on the scalp at interactive rates. 
METHODS:The proposed solution consists of an electromagnetic digitizer and an interactive visualization system that allows monitoring the movements of the digitizer on a real head with respect to the underlying cerebral cortical structures. GPU-based volume raycasting rendering is applied to unveil these structures from the corresponding magnetic resonance imaging volume. Scalp and cortical surface are estimated from the scanned volume to improve depth perception. An alignment algorithm between the real and scanned heads is devised to visually feedback the position of the stylus of the digitizer. Off-screen rendering of the depthmaps of the visible surfaces makes spatial positioning of a 2D interaction pointer possible.

RESULTS:We evaluated the alignment accuracy using four to eight anatomical landmarks and found seven to be a good compromise between precision and efficiency. Next, we evaluated reproducibility in positioning five arbitrarily chosen points on three volunteers by four operators over five sessions. In every session, seven anatomical landmarks were applied in the alignment of the real and the scanned head. For the same volunteer, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant differences within the five points digitized by the same operator over five sessions (α = 0.05). In addition, preliminary study of motor cortex activation by right-hand finger tapping showed the potential of our approach to increase functional fNIRS reproducibility.

CONCLUSIONS:Results of experiments suggest that the enhancement of the visualization of the location of the probes on the scalp, relative to the underlying cortical structures, improves reproducibility of fNIRS measurements. As further work, we plan to study the fNIRS reproducibility in other cortical regions and in clinical settings using the proposed system.}},

abstract = {{Congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) is a known cause of hearing loss directly caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Hearing loss might result from sensory, neural, or sensorineural lesions. Early treated infants rarely develop hearing loss, but retinochoroidal lesions, intracranial calcifications and hydrocephalus are common. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the brain evoked hemodynamic responses of CT and healthy infants during four auditory stimuli: mother infant directed speech, researcher infant directed speech, mother reading and researcher recorded. Children underwent Transitionally Evoked Otoacoustic Emission Auditory Testing and Automated Brainstem Auditory Response tests with normal auditory results, but with a tendency for greater latencies in the CT group compared to the control group. We assessed brain hemodynamics with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurements from 61 infants, and we present fNIRS results as frequency maps of activation and deactivation for each stimulus. By evaluating infants in the three first months of life, we observed an individual heterogeneous brain activation pattern in response to all auditory stimuli for both groups. Each channel was activated or deactivated in less than 30\% of children for all stimuli. There is a need of prospective studies to evaluate if the neurologic or auditory changes course with compromise of children outcomes.}},

abstract = {{The cortical microvascular cerebral blood flow response (CBF) to different changes in head-of-bed (HOB) position has been shown to be altered in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) by diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) technique. However, the relationship between these relative ΔCBF changes and associated systemic blood pressure changes has not been studied, even though blood pressure is a major driver of cerebral blood flow. Transcranial DCS data from four studies measuring bilateral frontal microvascular cerebral blood flow in healthy controls (n = 15), patients with asymptomatic severe internal carotid artery stenosis (ICA, n = 27), and patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS, n = 72) were aggregated. DCS-measured CBF was measured in response to a short head-of-bed (HOB) position manipulation protocol (supine/elevated/supine, 5 min at each position). In a sub-group (AIS, n = 26; ICA, n = 14; control, n = 15), mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured dynamically during the protocol. After elevated positioning, DCS CBF returned to baseline supine values in controls (p = 0.890) but not in patients with AIS (9.6\% [6.0,13.3], mean 95\% CI, p < 0.001) or ICA stenosis (8.6\% [3.1,14.0], p = 0.003)). MAP in AIS patients did not return to baseline values (2.6 mmHg [0.5, 4.7], p = 0.018), but in ICA stenosis patients and controls did. Instead ipsilesional but not contralesional CBF was correlated with MAP (AIS 6.0\%/mmHg [− 2.4,14.3], p = 0.038; ICA stenosis 11.0\%/mmHg [2.4,19.5], p < 0.001). The observed associations between ipsilateral CBF and MAP suggest that short HOB position changes may elicit deficits in cerebral autoregulation in cerebrovascular disorders. Additional research is required to further characterize this phenomenon.}},

Although CAS is strongly associated with impaired cerebral hemodynamics and neurodegeneration, the mechanisms underlying hemodynamic impairment in the microvasculature remain unknown. In this work, we employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to introduce a methodological approach for quantifying the temporal delay of the evoked hemodynamic response. The method was validated during a vasodilatory task (breath-holding) in 50 CAS patients and 20 controls. Our results suggest that the hemodynamic response to breath-holding can be delayed by up to 6 s in the most severe patients, a significant increase from the median 4 s measured for the control group (p = 0.01). In addition, the fraction of brain regions that responded to the task decreased as the CAS severity increased, from a median of 90\% in controls to 73\% in the most severe CAS group (p = 0.04). The presence of collateral circulation increases the response to breath-holding and decreases the average time delays across the brain, although the number of communicating arteries alone cannot predict these fNIRS-based hemodynamic variables (p > 0.09). Overall, this work proposes a method to quantitatively assess impaired cerebral hemodynamics in CAS patients.}},

Concomitantly, graph theory has been increasingly employed in neuroscience to model the brain's functional connectivity (FC) and to investigate it in a variety of contexts. The aims of this study were: 1) to investigate the reorganization of network topology in the ipsilesional (IL) and contralesional (CL) hemispheres of stroke patients with (motor stroke group) and without (control stroke group) motor impairment, and 2) to predict motor recovery through the relationship between local topological variations of the functional network and increased motor function. We modeled the brain's FC as a graph using fMRI data, and we characterized its interactions with the following graph metrics: degree, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and betweenness centrality (BC). For both patient groups, BC yielded the largest variations between the two analyzed time points, especially in the motor stroke group. This group presented significant correlations (P<0.05) between average BC changes and the improvements in upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer (UE-FM) scores at the primary sensorimotor cortex and the supplementary motor area for the CL hemisphere. These regions participate in processes related to the selection, planning, and execution of movement. Generally, higher increases in average BC over these areas were related to larger improvements in UE-FM assessment. Although the sample was small, these results suggest the possibility of using BC as an indication of brain plasticity mechanisms following stroke.}},

It is demonstrated in the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging literature that frontoparietal networks are involved with attentive performance while default mode networks are involved with inattentive performance. Yet, it is still not clear whether similar results would be found with functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy. The goal of our study was to investigate differences in hemodynamic activity measured by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy between fast and slow responses on a simple sustained attention task both before and after stimulus onset. Thirty healthy adults took part in the study. Our results have shown differences between fast and slow responses only on channels over medial frontal cortex and inferior parietal cortex (p < 0,05). These differences were observed both before and after stimulus presentation. It is discussed that functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy is a good tool to investigate the frontoparietal network and its relationship with performance in attention tasks; it could be used to further investigate other approaches on attention, such as the dual network model of cognitive control and brain states views based on complex systems analysis; and finally, it could be used to investigate attention in naturalistic settings.}},

In this vein, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an attractive choice due to its portability, flexibility, and low cost, allowing for bedside imaging of brain function. While promising, fNIRS suffers from non-neural signal contaminations (i.e., systemic physiological noise), which can increase correlation across fNIRS channels, leading to spurious rsFC networks. In the present work, we hypothesized that additional measurements with short channels, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and end-tidal CO2 could provide a better understanding of the effects of systemic physiology on fNIRS-based resting-state networks. To test our hypothesis, we acquired 12 min of resting-state data from 10 healthy participants. Unlike previous studies, we investigated the efficacy of different pre-processing approaches in extracting resting-state networks. Our results are in agreement with previous studies and reinforce the fact that systemic physiology can overestimate rsFC. We expanded on previous work by showing that removal of systemic physiology decreases intra- and inter-subject variability, increasing the ability to detect neural changes in rsFC across groups and over longitudinal studies. Our results show that by removing systemic physiology, fNIRS can reproduce resting-state networks often reported with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Finally, the present work details the effects of systemic physiology and outlines how to remove (or at least ameliorate) their contributions to fNIRS signals acquired at rest.}},

abstract = {{Brain fingerprinting refers to identifying participants based on their functional patterns. Despite its success with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain fingerprinting with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) still lacks adequate validation. We investigated how fNIRS-specific acquisition features (limited spatial information and nonneural contributions) influence resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) patterns at the intra-subject level and, therefore, brain fingerprinting. We performed multiple simultaneous fNIRS and fMRI measurements in 29 healthy participants at rest. Data were preprocessed following the best practices, including the removal of motion artifacts and global physiology. The rsFC maps were extracted with the Pearson correlation coefficient. Brain fingerprinting was tested with pairwise metrics and a simple linear classifier. Our results show that average classification accuracy with fNIRS ranges from 75\% to 98\%, depending on the number of runs and brain regions used for classification. Under the right conditions, brain fingerprinting with fNIRS is close to the 99.9\% accuracy found with fMRI. Overall, the classification accuracy is more impacted by the number of runs and the spatial coverage than the choice of the classification algorithm. This work provides evidence that brain fingerprinting with fNIRS is robust and reliable for extracting unique individual features at the intra-subject level once relevant spatiotemporal constraints are correctly employed.}},
